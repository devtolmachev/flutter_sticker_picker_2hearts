**README File for Dart, Flutter Sticker Picker Library**

**Description**
---------------

The Flutter Sticker Picker library is a simple and convenient tool for selecting stickers in Flutter applications. This library allows users to select stickers from a collection and use them in their apps.

**Installation**
-------------

To use this library, add the following line to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_sticker_picker: ^1.0.0
```

Then run the command `flutter pub get` in your terminal to load the dependencies.

**Usage**
--------------

To use the library, import it in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sticker_picker/flutter_sticker_picker.dart';
```

Then create an instance of the `StickerPickerView` class and pass it a collection of stickers:

```dart
StickerPickerView(
    categories: [
      LoveStickersCategory()
    ],
    onStickerSelected: (stickerSelected) {
        debugPrint(
            "sticker selected $stickerSelected",
        );
    },
),
```

**Parameters**
-------------

* `categories`: a collection of stickers categories to be displayed in the picker.
* `onStickerSelected`: a function that will be called when a user selects a sticker.

**Example**
------------

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sticker_picker/flutter_sticker_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: StickerPicker(
            categories: [
                LoveStickersCategory()
            ],
            onStickerSelected: (sticker) {
              print('Sticker selected: ${sticker.name}');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
